# Group Scholar Rubric Kit Progress

## Iteration 1
- Created a rubric kit microsite with sections for modules, workflow, and signal library.
- Designed a bold visual system (Fraunces + Space Grotesk, warm gradients, tactile cards).
- Added clear CTAs and a rubric snapshot card to convey the tool quickly.
